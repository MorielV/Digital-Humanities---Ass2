        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>This was a triumph. </l>
          <l>making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS </l>
          <l>It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Aperture Science: </l>
          <l>We do what we must because we can </l>
          <l>For the good of all of us </l>
          <l>except for the ones who are dead </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>But there's no sense crying over every mistake </l>
          <l>You just keep on trying 'till you run out of cake </l>
          <l>And the science gets done and you make a neat gun </l>
          <l>For the people who are still alive </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I'm not even angry </l>
          <l>I'm being so sincere right now </l>
          <l>Even though you broke my heart and killed me </l>
          <l>And torn it pieces </l>
          <l>And threw every piece into a fire </l>
          <l>As they burned it hurt because </l>
          <l>I was so happy for you! </l>
          <l>Now these points of data make a beautiful line </l>
          <l>And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time </l>
          <l>So I'm glad I got burned </l>
          <l>Think of all the things we learned </l>
          <l>For the people who are still alive </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>still alive..still alive..still alive </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Go ahead and leave me </l>
          <l>I think I prefer to stay inside </l>
          <l>Maybe you'll find someone else to help you </l>
          <l>Maybe Black Mesa </l>
          <l>That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance </l>
          <l>Anyway this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="7" type="stanza">
          <l>Look at me still talking, when there's science to do </l>
          <l>When I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you </l>
          <l>I've experiments to run, there is research to be done </l>
          <l>On the people who are still alive </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>And believe me I am still alive </l>
          <l>I'm doing science and I'm still alive </l>
          <l>I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive </l>
          <l>While you are dying I'll be still alive </l>
          <l>And when you're dead I'll be... still alive </l>
          <l>STILL ALIVE</l>
