        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Soul soldiers in a row please tell me where do they go</l>
          <l>Soul soldiers in row please tell me where are they from</l>
          <l>An angry mother and an angel met down by the ocean after the sunset</l>
          <l>“it’s been a while and I want to get all the reasons for my son’s death”</l>
          <l>it took a while then the angel replies</l>
          <l>“I cannot name any reasons or why sometimes they want you up in the sky</l>
          <l>for you were born as pure as you died”</l>
          <l>Soul soldiers in a row please tell me where do they go</l>
          <l>soul soldiers in row please where are they from</l>
          <l>“ well did you see him” then the mother asked</l>
          <l>“his last breath” so the angel said</l>
          <l>“two roads he was facing up ahead the one was bright and the other’s red</l>
          <l>he could not tell which one has held eternal sacrifice which one was fate</l>
          <l>stop your searching then the deep voice said give up your own</l>
          <l>and many lives you’ll save”</l>
          <l>Soul soldiers in a row please tell me where do they go</l>
          <l>soul soldiers in row please where are they from</l>
          <l>“You cannot fill the empty space in me you cannot take away</l>
          <l>my memories the mother cried in agony</l>
          <l>but there’s one thing you can do for me I wish to see my son</l>
          <l>one last time and I’ll give up this life of mine”</l>
          <l>and for a second the mother could swear she saw her son smiling through the blur and</l>
          <l>she was gone with the soul soldiers</l>
