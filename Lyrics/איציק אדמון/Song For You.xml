        <head>Song For You</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>All day long </l>
          <l>I think about a song </l>
          <l>That would be </l>
          <l>A song for every one </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>All day long </l>
          <l>I think of what went wrong </l>
          <l>As I sing A song for you </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I don't know Where I am going </l>
          <l>And I don't know who we are </l>
          <l>I don't know what I believe in </l>
          <l>Well, I don't want to think so far </l>
          <l>Silent dreams and silent kisses </l>
          <l>And a silent memory </l>
          <l>Like a child that comes back home </l>
          <l>He doesn't come back home </l>
          <l>Come back home to me </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Every night </l>
          <l>I think about your love </l>
          <l>And tonight I wrote a song for you </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Every night </l>
          <l>I think about your smile </l>
          <l>As I sing, A song for you </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Every word has got a meaning </l>
          <l>But every word we say is free </l>
          <l>And you can take it as you want it </l>
          <l>It doesn't matter much to me </l>
          <l>Every dream has got a meaning </l>
          <l>But every dream we have is free </l>
          <l>And you can dream it as you want it </l>
          <l>It doesn't matte much to me </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="7" type="stanza">
          <l>Every time has got a meaning </l>
          <l>But we are living here and now </l>
          <l>And you can live it as you want it </l>
          <l>It really doesn't </l>
          <l>It doesn't matter how</l>
