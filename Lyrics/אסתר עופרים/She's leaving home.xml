        <head>She's leaving home</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Wednesday morning at five o'clock</l>
          <l>as the day begins</l>
          <l>Silently closing her bedroom door</l>
          <l>Leaving the note that she hoped would say more</l>
          <l>She goes downstairs to the kitchen</l>
          <l>clutching her handkerchief</l>
          <l>Quietly turning the back door key</l>
          <l>Stepping outside she is free</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>She (we gave her most of our lives)</l>
          <l>is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)</l>
          <l>home (we gave her everything money could buy)</l>
          <l>She's leaving home after living alone for</l>
          <l>so many years (bye bye)</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown</l>
          <l>Picks up the letter that's lying there</l>
          <l>Standing alone at the top of the stairs</l>
          <l>She breaks down and cries to her husband</l>
          <l>Daddy our baby's gone</l>
          <l>Why should she treat us so thoughtlessly</l>
          <l>How could she do this to me</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>She (We never thought of ourselves)</l>
          <l>is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)</l>
          <l>home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)</l>
          <l>She's leaving home after living alone for</l>
          <l>so many years (bye bye)</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away</l>
          <l>Waiting to keep the appointment she made</l>
          <l>Meeting a man from the motor trade</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>She (what did we do that was wrong)</l>
          <l>is having (we didn't know it was wrong)</l>
          <l>fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)</l>
          <l>Something inside that was always denied for</l>
          <l>so many years (bye bye)</l>
          <l>She's leaving home (bye bye)</l>
