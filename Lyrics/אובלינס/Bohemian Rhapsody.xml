          <l>Is this the real life? </l>
          <l>Is this just fantasy? </l>
          <l>Caught in a landslide, </l>
          <l>No escape from reality. </l>
          <l>Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see, </l>
          <l>I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, </l>
          <l>Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low, </l>
          <l>Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me. </l>

          <l>Mama just killed a man, </l>
          <l>Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead. </l>
          <l>Mama, life had just begun, </l>
          <l>But now I've gone and thrown it all away. </l>
          <l>Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry, </l>
          <l>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, </l>

          <l>Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go, </l>
          <l>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth. </l>
          <l>Mama, ooh, I don't want to die, </l>
