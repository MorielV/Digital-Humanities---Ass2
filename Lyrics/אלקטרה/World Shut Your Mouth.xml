          <l>She's flying in the face of fashion now </l>
          <l>She seems to have a will of her own </l>
          <l>She's flying in the face of fashion now </l>
          <l>She seems to have it all chromed </l>
          <l>The time was going so frequently </l>
          <l>She said if I try harder again </l>
          <l>She's flying in the face of fashion now </l>
          <l>She sells the world annually to a friend </l>

          <l>She sings, "World, shut your mouth, shut your mouth </l>
          <l>Put your head back in the clouds and shut your mouth </l>

          <l>She always used to live so secretly </l>
          <l>She'd be seen in and out of the sound </l>
          <l>She's taking on the role of the four winds now </l>
          <l>She's having tea there out in the crowd </l>
          <l>She's flying in the face of fashion now </l>
          <l>She seems to have a will of her own </l>
          <l>In lieu of what you're saying so frequently </l>
          <l>She seems to have, it all adds up </l>
