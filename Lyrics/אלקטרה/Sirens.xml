        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>This car is cruising much too fast </l>
          <l>Dropping into hell now </l>
          <l>A crowd of people with no past</l>
          <l> They’ve seen their hero dead now </l>
          <l> Been working Monday Tuesday Wednesday ‘ till morning comes</l>
          <l>and through the weekend drinkin’ doin’ da doo ron ron</l>
          <l> In San Diego </l>
          <l> Serving my time for something they know </l>
          <l> Had to be done </l>
          <l>A life on death row</l>
          <l> My necklace rested on your neck </l>
          <l>Never was a fighter </l>
          <l> Shooting made easy when you’re numb </l>
          <l> I saw the noose was tightened </l>
          <l> Was working Monday Tuesday Wednesday ‘till morning came </l>
          <l> And through the weekend drinkin doing my walk of shame </l>
          <l>In San Diego</l>
          <l>Ripping my time ‘cause something I sowed </l>
          <l>Wasn’t declined </l>
          <l>It’s time I let go </l>
          <l> She was the crime,  I was the lie,  It was the perfect needle </l>
          <l> We were doing so fine till the wave brought us down </l>
          <l> In San Diego </l>
          <l> Sinking in salty water I call your name </l>
          <l> Hang on to that endless poem then start again </l>
          <l> Yes it’s the sound of me preachin’ </l>
          <l> It's the howl of you screamin’ </l>
          <l> Burn your soul down </l>
          <l> Tortured and drowned </l>
          <l> My own true freak show </l>
          <l> Serving my time  for something they know</l>
          <l> Had to be done </l>
          <l> Its time I let go</l>
          <l>She was the crime,  I was the lie,  It was the perfect needle </l>
          <l> We were doing so fine till the wave brought us down </l>
          <l>In San Diego</l>
