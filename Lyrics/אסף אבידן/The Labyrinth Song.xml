        <head>The Labyrinth Song</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Evening rises, darkness threatens to engulf us all</l>
          <l>But there's a moon above, it's shining and I think I hear a call</l>
          <l>It's just a whisper through the trees, my ears can hardly make it out</l>
          <l>But I can hear it in my heart, vibrating, strong as if she shouts</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my head</l>
          <l>I came here like you asked, I killed the beast, that part of me is dead</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my head</l>
          <l>If only I'd have listened to you when you offered me that thread </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Everything is quite, and I'm not exactly sure</l>
          <l>If it really was your voice I heard, or maybe it's a door</l>
          <l>That's closing up some hero's back, on his track to be a man</l>
          <l>Can it be that all us heroes have a path, but not a plan?</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my mind</l>
          <l>I wish I had that string, it's so damn dark, I think I'm going blind</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my mind</l>
          <l>For the life of me, I don't remember what I came to find</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Now tell me princess, are you strolling through your sacred grove?</l>
          <l>And is the moon still shining? You're the only thing I'm thinking of</l>
          <l>The sword you gave me, it was heavy, I just had to lay it down</l>
          <l>It's funny how defenseless I can feel here when there's nobody around</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my heart</l>
          <l>I was blind, I thought you'd bind me, but you offered me a chart</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my heart</l>
          <l>If I’d known that you could guide me, I'd have listened from the start</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Somewhere up there midnight strikes, I think I hear the fall</l>
          <l>Of little drops of water, magnified against the barren wall</l>
          <l>It's more a feeling than a substance, but there's nobody around</l>
          <l>And when I'm in here all alone, it's just enough to let me drown</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I was coming, but I failed you in this labyrinth of my past</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, let me sing you, and we'll make each other last</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, I have failed you in this labyrinth of my past</l>
          <l>Oh Ariadne, let me sing you, and we'll make each other last</l>
