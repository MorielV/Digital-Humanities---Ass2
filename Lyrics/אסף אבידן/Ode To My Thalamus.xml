        <head>Ode To My Thalamus</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>The clouds are gathering in the sky above</l>
          <l>I know this one's gonna hurt my love</l>
          <l>Birds are shouting through the Mangrove trees</l>
          <l>They know the difference between a storm and breeze</l>
          <l>I too have felt this once before</l>
          <l>I hear that pounding and it's at my door</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Outside it's boiling, but the water is cold</l>
          <l>All signs point to that I'm getting old</l>
          <l>The waves are rising and I take that dive</l>
          <l>To hold a breath is not to be alive</l>
          <l>I felt it then, I feel it now</l>
          <l>I know its coming but I don't know how</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>It's taking us apart, this Helicase of love</l>
          <l>We're nothing but post-modern art, what were we thinking of</l>
          <l>This is how it has to be – This is how it has to be</l>
          <l>I'm constructing but I shouldn't be</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>My blood is boiling and the callus is hot</l>
          <l>My veins are twisting in a sailor's knot</l>
          <l>My Thalamus is growing down into my tongue</l>
          <l>And all I taste is pain in every kiss and song</l>
          <l>I know this story, and I know it well</l>
          <l>The cracks are showing in my pearly shell</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Outside I'm shaking and I feel them chills</l>
          <l>There go both of my Achilles Heels</l>
          <l>I fall down naked waiting for the storm</l>
          <l>My arms are open, waiting to transform</l>
          <l>The birds go flying, I hear them cry</l>
          <l>I know it's coming but I don't know why</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>It's taking us apart, this Helicase of love</l>
          <l>We're nothing but post-modern art, what were we thinking of</l>
          <l>This is how it has to be, This is how it has to be</l>
          <l>This is how it has to be, This is how it has to be</l>
          <l>This is how it has to be, This is how it has to be</l>
