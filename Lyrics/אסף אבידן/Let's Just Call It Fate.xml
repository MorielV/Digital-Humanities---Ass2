        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Tears are clouding up a sunny day</l>
          <l>And I wish it’d turn up any other way</l>
          <l>But I don't think that you'd care</l>
          <l>If I stepped out of your hair</l>
          <l>And you'd find me anywhere - but here</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I wish it wasn't so</l>
          <l>I'll say it again - I wish it wasn't so</l>
          <l>But I don't think that you'd mind</l>
          <l>If I left this room behind</l>
          <l>And I'd step outside to find - some other place</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Let's say that it's OK, and just leave it at that</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Things are different than they seem</l>
          <l>Everybody's looking from the outside, but we're both stuck within</l>
          <l>And I'd wish that you would say</l>
          <l>That you wanted me to stay</l>
          <l>And we'll find some other way but this</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Let's say that it's OK, and just leave it at that</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Maybe I could wait</l>
          <l>But I think that it's too late</l>
          <l>So let's just call it Fate - from here</l>
