        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>What I say when I say that I miss you</l>
          <l>Is that I will always love me more</l>
          <l>What I need when I bleed just to drown you</l>
          <l>Is that someday you'll become a shore</l>
          <l>It's my wave that will crave and will pull you</l>
          <l>And another that will push you back</l>
          <l>We will be just a sea they can sail through</l>
          <l>They can split us but we never crack</l>
          <l>On occasions our sea will swallow</l>
          <l>613 shades of Sad</l>
          <l>And occasionally we’ll be just shallow </l>
          <l>Enough for them to see the things we had</l>
          <l>20,000 different leagues of sorrow</l>
          <l>They will surface but we'll let them drown</l>
          <l>And the moon will lift our holy bodies</l>
          <l>And we'll live as one</l>
          <l>With the rate and the weight that I pound you</l>
          <l>You will tell me that you understand</l>
          <l>Every shell I'll propel just to spite you</l>
          <l>You will break it and you'll turn to sand</l>
          <l>We will be just a sea and a shoreline</l>
          <l>We won't need no words, we'll have the tide</l>
          <l>I will bleed and I'll plead that I miss you</l>
          <l>Even though you'll never leave my side</l>
          <l>On occasions our sea will swallow</l>
          <l>613 shades of Sad</l>
          <l>And occasionally we’ll be just shallow </l>
          <l>Enough for them to see the things we had</l>
          <l>20,000 different leagues of sorrow</l>
          <l>They will surface but we'll let them drown</l>
          <l>And the moon will lift our holy bodies</l>
          <l>And we'll live as one</l>
