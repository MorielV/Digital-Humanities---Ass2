        <head>Fair Haired Traveller</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>On a train ride from some place bad, to some place little better</l>
          <l>In-between my youth and manhood, was the place I met her</l>
          <l>She was just a skinny, brown-eyed girl, with a hunger for tomorrow</l>
          <l>And I was then obese by pain, I had all that I could swallow</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Oh fair haired travelling girl</l>
          <l>Keep on travelling on</l>
          <l>Oh fair haired travelling girl</l>
          <l>It's just the seat that you have is wrong</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Her eyes were packing passed regrets, in her lips there was redemption</l>
          <l>And she mistook my coat for love, as she wore it for affection</l>
          <l>As she took the seat beside me, I inhaled all of her laughter</l>
          <l>And she forgot there is a past, while I forgot there is an after</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Oh fair haired travelling girl</l>
          <l>Keep on travelling on</l>
          <l>Oh fair haired travelling girl</l>
          <l>It's just the seat that you have is wrong</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>On a train ride from some place gone, to some place almost certain</l>
          <l>In-between my flesh and bone, was the place I met her</l>
          <l>And wrapped up in my coat of shame, she laid there sleeping tightly</l>
          <l>And as the train pulled to another stop, I knew that she'd go on without me</l>
        </lg>
        <lg Chorus="yes" number="6" type="stanza">
          <l>Oh fair haired travelling girl</l>
          <l>Keep on travelling on</l>
          <l>Oh fair haired travelling girl</l>
          <l>It's just the seat that you have is wrong</l>
