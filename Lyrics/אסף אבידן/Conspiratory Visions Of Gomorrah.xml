        <head>Conspiratory Visions Of Gomorrah</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Sorrow is back in your eyes</l>
          <l>Pulling us to the depth</l>
          <l>We could have lasted like planets</l>
          <l>But your weight dragged us both to our death</l>
          <l>They've been sober around you</l>
          <l>And I truly believed it'll suffice</l>
          <l>But you're an addict for torture</l>
          <l>And the sorrow is back in your eyes</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>The minor sonatas of Beethoven</l>
          <l>Roll through your hips</l>
          <l>But the words you are aching to sing</l>
          <l>Are glued to your lips</l>
          <l>They've been burning the wrongly accused</l>
          <l>While you silently dance</l>
          <l>But your beauty was such</l>
          <l>That they all gladly stood in line for the chance</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>The amber around you</l>
          <l>Has stiffened your thought and your limb</l>
          <l>You're a fossil of love</l>
          <l>A relic, an echoing hymn</l>
          <l>The purity that once you delivered</l>
          <l>Dissolved into sand</l>
          <l>Lot has escaped and is dancing</l>
          <l>But you're hardly able to stand</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>You won't work off your debt</l>
          <l>Until you strip to your heart and your bone</l>
          <l>The love that was once in your veins</l>
          <l>Will dry into stone</l>
          <l>The mist and the fog</l>
          <l>Will densen themselves to a wall</l>
          <l>And you'll finally sing</l>
          <l>But I won't be there to hear your call</l>
        </lg>
