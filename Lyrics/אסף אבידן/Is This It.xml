        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>If I threw my broken body</l>
          <l>Let it shatter on the rocks</l>
          <l>Would you pick up all my imperfections</l>
          <l>Keep them hidden in your jewelry box</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>Would you help this old man singing</l>
          <l>Would you save this little boy</l>
          <l>Would you treat me like a baby</l>
          <l>And let treat you like his toy</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Is this it? Honey is this it?</l>
          <l>This is it.</l>

        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>Would you break me like a prism</l>
          <l>Would you see my different sides</l>
          <l>Would you separate the bright ones</l>
          <l>Hang them on your laundry line</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>Would you help this tired Abraham</l>
          <l>It's not just Isaac that is crying</l>
          <l>For he who is busy loving</l>
          <l>Is both living and is also dying</l>

          <l>Would you know me like a doctor</l>
          <l>Would you sing me like a hymn</l>
          <l>Would you touch me like a bridesmaid</l>
          <l>In some husband's dirty little dream</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>When these defeated lips have failed me</l>
          <l>Would you save my hungry eyes</l>
          <l>Would you milk your breasts for honey</l>
          <l>Would you feed me all your pretty lies</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="9" type="stanza">
          <l>Is this it? Honey is this really it?</l>
          <l>It's all that we've been praying for</l>
          <l>Honey is this it?</l>
          <l>It's all that we've been waiting for</l>
          <l>It's all that we've been praying for</l>
