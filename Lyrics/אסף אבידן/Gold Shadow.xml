        <head>Gold Shadow</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>There's a gold shadow seeping through the door</l>
          <l>There's a cold sparrow lying still upon the floor</l>
          <l>Dead and true as lipstick</l>
          <l>Slow as the speed of skin</l>
          <l>There's a gold, gold shadow growing from within</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>There's a bent willow in the moonlight painted blue</l>
          <l>There's a spent window silhouetting you</l>
          <l>Deep and true as whiskey</l>
          <l>Soft and sure as lies</l>
          <l>There's a bent, bent willow reflecting in your eyes</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>But now there's a girl out in a boat</l>
          <l>Her arms are outstretched and she's barely afloat</l>
          <l>There's a man on the shore, a rope in his hands</l>
          <l>It's tied to the boat, and he's pulling as hard as he can</l>
          <l>Not to bring her to him, but to pull the whole shore</l>
          <l>And the whole world with it, to her open door</l>
          <l>All his voices are her, All his voices are her</l>
          <l>All his voices are her, All his voices are her</l>
          <l>Has he been here before?</l>
          <l>Nobody's sure</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>There's a silver distance, a luminescent glimpse</l>
          <l>There's a river of resistance, dried to cracks upon your lips</l>
          <l>Brittle as believing</l>
          <l>Sticky as betrayal</l>
          <l>There's a silver distance opening up like a trail</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>There was a time before all the leaves</l>
          <l>Covered the beauty of Adam &amp; Eve </l>
          <l>And they were blind, and they were free</l>
          <l>To be whatever they wanted to be</l>
          <l>But now they are just a prayer in a song</l>
          <l>And he is so sorry for all that went wrong</l>
          <l>All his voices are her, All his voices are her</l>
          <l>All his voices are her, All his voices are her</l>
          <l>Has he been here before?</l>
          <l>Has he been here before?</l>
