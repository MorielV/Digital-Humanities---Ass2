        <head>My Tunnels Are Long And Dark These Days</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>Lately I’ve been picking at the fossil in my throat</l>
          <l>It's hard to stare into the ocean, and to try to stay afloat</l>
          <l>Now don't upset yourself due to the changing of my mood</l>
          <l>I'm hard to please sometimes - I'm hard to please sometimes </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>I'm on a staircase to the bottom of the bottom of my soul</l>
          <l>Although my feet are still connected they are out of my control</l>
          <l>Now please refrain yourself from worrying on my behalf</l>
          <l>I'm hard to understand sometimes - I'm hard to understand sometimes</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>Honey come with me, it's just you and me</l>
          <l>Baby believe it's as simple as can be</l>
          <l>I will be the jail that sets you free - I will be the jail that sets you free</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="4" type="stanza">
          <l>I'm shuffling underneath my pillow for the bed-crumbs of my mind</l>
          <l>It's hard to look there for a future, when I left it all behind</l>
          <l>Please don't condescend and say you've heard this one before</l>
          <l>I'm hard to please sometimes - I'm hard to please sometimes </l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="5" type="stanza">
          <l>And while you're offering a handshake to a goddamn amputee</l>
          <l>I feel my phantom heart is scratching in a train-wreck memory</l>
          <l>Please don't try to cure me with on rectifying glance</l>
          <l>I'm hard to understand sometimes - I'm hard to understand sometimes</l>
        </lg>

          <l>Honey come with me, it's just you and me</l>
          <l>Baby believe it's as simple as can be</l>
          <l>I will be the jail that sets you free</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="8" type="stanza">
          <l>I will be the jail that makes you</l>
          <l>I will be the jail that breaks you</l>
          <l>I will be the jail that sets you free</l>
