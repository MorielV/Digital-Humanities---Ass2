        <head>A Part Of This</head>
        <lg number="1" type="stanza">
          <l>It's understood that you don't want to be a part of this</l>
          <l>Although you could, but you have grown apart from this</l>
          <l>And I for one am sick of running in these circles dear</l>
          <l>And I for one would love the sound of your voice in my ear</l>
          <l>"It's crystal clear, although I'm here, I'm not a part of this"</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="2" type="stanza">
          <l>It's over due, so lets both put an end to this</l>
          <l>You know it's true, why don't you put an end to this?</l>
          <l>Our time is done, what was is gone, it's only memory</l>
          <l>That keeps us on, let's end this song with your voice telling me</l>
          <l>"It's crystal clear, although I'm here, I'm not a part of this"</l>
        </lg>
        <lg number="3" type="stanza">
          <l>I think I knew that it will have to end like this</l>
          <l>I'm blaming you, but I'm as much to blame in this</l>
          <l>It seems my heart right from the start was always split in two</l>
          <l>It is so far from what you are, and what I made of you</l>
          <l>"It's crystal clear, I wasn't here, I’m not a part of this…I’m not a part of this!</l>
          <l>It's crystal clear, I wasn't here… I've never been a part of this"</l>
